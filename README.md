# YouTube Notes Chrome Extension

![YouTube Notes Screenshot](screenshot.png)

A Chrome extension that allows you to take timestamped notes while watching YouTube videos. Notes are saved locally and can be used to quickly navigate back to specific parts of the video.

## Features

- **Timestamped Notes**: Automatically captures the current video time when you add a note.
- **Click to Seek**: Click on any note's timestamp to jump the video to that exact moment.
- **Side Panel UI**: Integrated seamlessly into the Chrome Side Panel for a native look and feel.
- **YouTube Design**: Styled to match the YouTube aesthetic (Dark/Light mode compatible styles - *currently optimized for light mode*).
- **Rich Text Copy**: One-click button to copy all notes to your clipboard. Pasting into rich text editors (like Google Docs or Notion) preserves the timestamps as clickable YouTube links.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
    - `Enter`: Add note.
    - `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter`: Add new line.
- **Persistence**: Notes are saved automatically per video using Chrome Storage.
